# This is a problem based learning project that I created for 
my first Java Programming course, CS102 in 2015 when 
I was a freshman at Yanbu University College. 
So go easy on me when you see it.
---------------------------------------- 

# It's a fun and creative game which was developed in order 
to help young children imporve their skills in calculating, 
memorizing, and thinking. 

----------------------------------------
# The goal of this game is to keep the baskets balanced 
the entire time. There are 5 levels in this game where in
each level the player will have to use one of the basic 
mathmetical operations on each level ( + - ร รท ) to balance the baskets. 
The player can have bonus prizes on each level when clicking the wizard's hat.

----------------------------------------
# This game helps with memorization because the player will have 
to select one of the falling balls by pressing on the keyboard. 
Each colored ball is linked to a certain letter.
